      <h2>About</h2>
      <div>
        We are the Asian American Students in Action (AASiA) at Williams College. Over the past few decades, much of
        AASiA&apos;s work has focused on the thirty-four year-long Asian American Studies Movement (#AASM). AASiA is now
        in a transitional period in which we seek to reframe and recenter Asian American politics in and beyond Williams
        College. Currently in progress is a working Mission Statement as well as a set of principles grounding our work.

      <h3>Working Mission Statement</h3>
      <div>
        The Asian American Students in Action (AASiA), as exhibited by the term “in action,” believes Asian America
        to be not only “who we are” but “what we do.” Therefore, the Asian America we are invested in is not merely an
        identity, but a political world we take part in building together. Indeed, our usage of “Asian America” refers
        to the term&apos;s anti-imperial, anti-capitalist, and feminist political origin in the Third World Liberation Front.
        At its core, AASiA is a political organization that seeks to politicize, mobilize, and organize Asian American
        students at Williams College.
