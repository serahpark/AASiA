# AASiA Website!

This app was developed for Asian American Students in Action (AASiA), a political student organization at Williams College. As a continual work in progress, this web app provides a platform for AASiA to post records of its organizing and programming as well as resources for community members both within and beyond the Williams campus. This app was created using ReactJS, MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. Currently, the app supports a forum feature with Google user authentication & authorization for users within the Williams organization.
